# Project Proposal

# Point Tracking

The project will essentially be based on point of reference tracking. Using the computer's camera, the program will look for a specific color (bright blue) on the screen, and will draw on the screen based on the movement of the marker.

## Scope
For the time being, the scope is restricted to allowing the user to draw on the screen using a bright blue marker (unless time permits).

## Update 1:
Created project structure and created line drawing/making functionality using a keyboard and a mouse. This is drawn on the image from videoGrabber.

## Update 2:
Created point tracking via green colored pen. Updated point tracking algorithm to create smoother lines with less noise. Added a clear function that safely deletes all the lines drawn on the heap and clears the screen. Discontinuous lines can be drawn.
